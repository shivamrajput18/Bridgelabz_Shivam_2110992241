To eliminaten the cost of calls to small functions,
     c++ proposes a new feature called Inline function.

An inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is invoked.
Complier replaces the function call with the corresponding function code.	
inline is a request not a command.

inline void fun();

void main(){

   fun();

}

void fun(){
  cout<<"You are in fun";
}
